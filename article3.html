        It's lonely, it's cold. It's scary. As I stand by the shores of this Island, I think to myself "How did you get here?!" I am surrounded by a sea of sorrow. Did I stand myself on this Island of melancholy bay by choice? Or did the winds of life blow in the wrong direction at the wrong time? Either way I seem to be stuck here. I cannot escape. I know it I am shackled with heavy chains of regret.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I can survive is occasional supplies of happiness and joy that wash cap on the shore. They are my lifeline. A hope that maybe one day I will find the courage to leave this place. All I do is watch the sun rise and set. The horizon looked like it was a hop skip and a jump away, yet it looked unfathomably far away.
      </p>

        As the days turned into nights, I lay back and looked at the beautiful sky, studded with stars. I take a deep breath and let it all out. The blood of sadness coursing through my vein's drained from my arms. The weight of my own expectations seem to be lifted from my heart. The sand on the island turned to snow, the shackles of regret turned to dust. The cold snow enveloped me in a blanket of warmth. I look up again. at the starry sky. The Stars began to fade one by one until there was only one lonesome dot left. It looked.... heavenly. So much so I would do anything just to stay in the moment and admire that one speck in the sky. I wanted to keep this star close to my heart. I reach out my hand in an attempt to take it in the palm of my hand. I grab the air and reality sinks in. The star belongs to the sky.I can never be the sky. I guess I need to look at it from far away and appreciate the joy it sparks in me. The blanket of warmth grew more and more comfortable. I let myself be overtaken by this feeling of freedom.
      </p>
        <p>
        I close my eyes in this desolate world and go to sleep for one last time.
