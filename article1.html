        You'll never be who you were, ever again. After you go through a heartbreak, you change. A lot. You don't really have any other choice. It's just the territory that comes with heartbreak. Your perspectives, opinions, and the way you look at life - will shift. Some pieces needed to go, but some pieces you're going to miss. All said and done, you'll be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which means that…No one is going to know you the way that they did. New people will know new parts of you. They'll know different parts of you. They'll know deeper parts of you too. But never the exact same version. Why does that hurt so much?
      </p>
      <p>
        There's nothing linear about your process. You're going to experience moments of profound healing and ease followed by waves of the heaviest grief. And there's no rhyme or reason…that IS the rhyme and reason. You'll stop trying to figure it out. You'll stop trying to timeline your process and label your stages of healing. You'll learn that all you can do is keep moving forward. One foot in front of the other. And so that's what you'll do.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at some point, you'll turn a corner. That pinch in your heart will begin fading. You'll cry about it for the last time - but you won't know that it's the last time. Hours will start to pass without a mere thought of it. Then days, weeks, and yes…months. And one day, down the line, it'll pop back into your brain when you least expect it. It'll sort of surprise you. And if you're busy, you won't think much of it. But if you have the time to sit back and remember, you'll have the ability to tap into the way your heart felt when you were going through everything that you are today. But the difference is that it will just be a memory. Temporary. One that you can get up and drive away from.
      </p>
      <p> One that doesn't feel so impossible to escape…</p>
