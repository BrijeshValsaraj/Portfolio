        When you're young, you believe that there will be many people with who you'll connect with deeply. Later in life, you come to realize that it only happens few times: A few moments, frozen in genuine beauty, where you look at someone and you know, from a place deep within yourself, that they are going to mean something to you, that they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to this kind of connection, it's important to understand that energy cannot be created or destroyed. If the depth is there, it cannot be denied, cannot slip through your fingers, cannot be something you successfully run away from due to fear of exposure or battle wounds. You can try to dismiss it, can try to stay protected and hidden from the warmth, but it always catches up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if it's meant to fit within the soul of you, if it's simply not your love to hold, no amount of bargaining with your heart will anchor it. That is the beauty of discovering the things that stay, the things that will fall into place. In a world of billions, in a world where we are seeking connection but avoiding eye contact, there are remarkable points of impact where you manage yourself to crash into someone who ends up breaking through the exterior. Someone who makes who grows contact with your heart, roots within it. Together, you beat the odds.
      </p>
      <p>If you have found human beings like this, I hope you protect them. I hope you risk your heart for what you feel. I hope you are worthy of something full, and pointed and real. I hope you never settle for less, because certain people are truly just rare, beautiful drops of borrowed light that find their way to you. You don't feel alien with them. The otherness never arrives. There isn't a version of yourself you have to shed in order to feel connected to them. They see you clearly. You are held there. You are chosen there. love becomes a safe place to rest your head. A place without artifice or armour There are no hiding spots. Everything is unguarded, and unvarnished, and there is freedom in that kind of openness, in that kind of vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>I promise it's worth fighting for.</p>
