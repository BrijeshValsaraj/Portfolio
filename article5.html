      <p>
        Slowly, through loving the right people, you will come to realize that the human beings who are meant for you in this life will not exhaust you, or hollow you out, or leave you feeling like you are hard to love. Slowly, you will come to realize that you do not have to romanticize the things in this life that hurt. You do not have to run towards the fire Love does not have to feel like a fight, does not have to feel like a battle, does not have to wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly, you will learn how to lay down your arms. How to walk away from there who will only love you in halves. Slowly, you will learn that you cannot love someone into loving you, or being ready, if they are not. You cannot close their hands around your heart if they are not willing to hold it themselves. You have to let them go. You have to focus on the people in your life who bring you home back to yourself. You have to focus on standing up for that kind of connection, on honoring that calm, because it exists, It exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I hope you learn to trust that, because when you come across it, when you ultimately experience it, it feels as if you are standing at a door you finally have the keys for. You enter it with ease. There is no fumbling through your jacket pocket trying to find the right way in. There is desperately reaching into your bag trying to uncover the point of access. You are no longer banging your fists against the door, asking to be invited in. You walk through, Soundlessly. Softly you take off your shoes. You hang your coat in the closet. You put on a pot of offer, You're home
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not find a love that is perfect, but you will find a love that is real
      </p>
      <p>You will not find a love that is perfect, but you will find a love that reminds you that goodness exists. This love, it will inject honey into the soul of you, it will feel like warmth has cracked within your bones. And you will see how it learns you, and fights for you, and stays to weather the storms by your side. You will be reminded that there is connection in a world that often chooses distance over depth. You will be reminded that there is hope to be found pouring from the fingertips of another human being, tucked between the layers of the things you have yet to discover about them. No, you will not find a love that is perfect, but you will find a love that is light, that isn't heavy to carry, that does not weigh down the core of you. You will finally understand that love was always meant to be soft. That it was always meant to be tender.
    </p>
    <p>No, you will not find a love that is perfect- but you will find a love that reminds you just how worthy you always were. This love, it will show you that you were never asking for too much, that the way you sent your heart to war for other human beings was not foolish, that the way you were incapable of loving in halves was not wrong. This love, it will show you that it was always okay to be the kind of person who loved in a way that was full, and nourished, and hopeful all over. That it was always okay to be the kind of person who could never shy away from their heart. This love, It will make up for all the times you were added to slaughter your instincts, for  all the times you tried to break yourself down just to you tried to comfort or impress sоmeone who was not meant for you. This love, it will show you that you were always worthy of it, that you always deserve to be seen, and understood, that you always deserved to be held and cared for the way you held and cared for all that came before it. This love will teach you - that you were never too much. You were always enough, you were always enough.
