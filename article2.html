        "But we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever"- Haruki Murakami
      </p>
      <p>
       With time, I've come to realize that we are often not ready to let go of the things that hurt us whether it's people, memories of dreams. As humans, we feel proud to hold onto things. In the name of never giving up, we hurt ourselves a lot. Sometimes bravery is in letting things go and taking a deep, calming breath. It doesn't make you a loser; in fact, it can open up new paths and perspectives that we would otherwise miss
      </p>
      <p>
        Healing doesn't start until we accept that it's time to move on. It begins when we stop victimizing ourselves and empowers us to go on a new journey. It's sometimes easy to be in the same space even if it hurts because taking a step forward can be daunting and filled with unknowns. But as Murakami has said, we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever. It's time to take a chance and move forward boldly towards a new and wonderful possibilities and opportunities.
